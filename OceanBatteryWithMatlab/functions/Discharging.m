%% DISCHARGING MODEL
%   This model simulates the discharging phase of the Ocean Battery.

%% Charging the Ocean Battery 
% Charging; %Runs the charging script. 

%% Setting parameters
OB_parameters; %Sets the parameters specified in OB parameters.

%% Initial calculations
A_turbine = pi * (0.5*D_turbine)^2; %[m^2] Area of the turbine outlet.
Interp_steps = (1/Delta_t)+1; %Calculates the required amount of steps between two seconds based on Delta_t. Is used in interpolation. 
startup_steps = (1/Delta_t)*t_open_ball_valve; %[-] Number of iterations that passes while the ball valve opens up.

%% Model initialization
i = 1; %Initial value for i.
V_wat_bladder(1) = V_wat_rigid_charging(1)-V_wat_rigid_charging(end) + (Capacity_rigid - V_wat_rigid_charging(1)); %[m^3] Initial value for the volume of water present in the bladder.
Q_turbine_a(1) = 2.6e-3; %[m^3/s] Initial guess of the flow throught the turbine. 

%% Overshoot correction
%   The volume that is left in the reservoir is almost always a negative
%   number because charging script slightly "overshoots" the emptying of 
%   the rigid reservoir. This if-statement ensures that the starting volume
%   of the rigid reservoir is either zero (empty) or larger than zero.

%% Calculation of the starting flow

%   seconds of operation is calculated. "t_open_ball_valve" seconds is the

%   opened, the "startup-phase" is completed. The flow (Q_turbine) after 12
%   seconds will be used to model this phase. The startup is assumed to be
%   instant in this part.
